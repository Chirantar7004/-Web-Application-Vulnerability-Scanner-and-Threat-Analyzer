# -Web-Application-Vulnerability-Scanner-and-Threat-Analyzer
Research based Hybrid Scanner to detect various SQL, JavaScript and XSS vulnerabilities
A system that overcomes flaws and shortcomings of currently used industrial methods for detection and prevention of threats.
Infused black box testing techniques where vulnerabilities in the software are discovered by performing attacks while software is deployed in external network with white box techniques where security based compiler scans the code to determine presence of vulnerabilities in the code.
Designed white box scanner with help of tokens generated in normal compiler whereas black box testing is designed by extensive attack algorithms which are normally used by attacker
Significantly reduced number of false positives and false negatives which increased accuracy and efficiency to a new level.
Automation was provided with help of Python so that entire process of discovering vulnerabilities required least human interactions.
Designed rehabilitation system synchronized with vulnerabilities to provide instructions regarding code lines which are vulnerable and type of vulnerability and set of instructions to fix it.
